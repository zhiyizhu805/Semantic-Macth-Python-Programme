# Semantic Match Python Program 🧠

## Overview

This project is a semantic match Python program that leverages the BERT language model for semantic matching, along with various other dependencies. The execution time for running the program may vary depending on the size of the files being processed. Rust is also required for building some components.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.8 or higher 🐍
- **Rust**: Required for building some components 🦀

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Python

Make sure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.

### Step 2: Install Rust

Some dependencies require Rust to be built. Follow these instructions to install Rust:

1. Open a terminal window.
2. Run the following command:
   \```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   \```
3. Follow the prompts and choose the installation options.
4. Verify Rust installation:
   \```bash
   rustc --version
   \```
   For more detailed instructions, visit the [official Rust website](https://rustup.rs/).

### Step 3: Set Up a Virtual Environment 🌐

Navigate to the project directory and set up a virtual environment using:
\```bash
python3 -m virtualenv semantic-match
source semantic-match/bin/activate
\```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies 📦

Install the required dependencies using:
\```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\```

## Usage 🚀
